 *Integer-to-ASCII needs to convert data from a standard integer
 *type into an ASCII string.
 *All operations need to be performed using pointer arithmetic,
 *not array indexing.
 *The number you wish to convert is passed in as a signed 32-bit integer.
 *You should be able to support bases 2 to 16 by specifying the integer
 *value of the base you wish to convert to (base).
 *Copy the converted character string to the uint8_t* pointer
 *passed in as a parameter (ptr).
 *The signed 32-bit number will have a maximum string size (Think base 2).
 *You must place a null terminator at the end of the converted c-string.
 *Function should return the length of the converted data
 *(including a negative sign). Example my_itoa(ptr, 1234, 10)
 *should return an ASCII string length of 5 (including the null terminator).
 *This function needs to handle signed data.
